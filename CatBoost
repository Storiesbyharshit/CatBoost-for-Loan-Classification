CatBoost is a fast, scalable, high performance gradient boosting on decision trees library. Used for ranking, classification, regression and other ML tasks.
- Reduce time spent on parameter tuning, because CatBoost provides great results with default parameters
- Improve your training results with CatBoost that allows you to use non-numeric factors, instead of having to pre-process your data or spend time and effort turning it to numbers.
- Train your model on a fast implementation of gradient-boosting algorithm for GPU
- Apply your trained model quickly and efficiently even to latency-critical tasks using CatBoost's model applier
